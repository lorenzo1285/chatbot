## Notable Projects

### Revenue Forecasting Initiative

* **Objective:** Forecast net revenue for the next six months using a bottom‑up approach, with an error target below 10%.
* **Methodology:**

  1. Forecasted Master Agreements (MAs) leveraging trend and seasonality.
  2. Predicted Period-over-Period (PoP) growth based on MA forecasts to capture net changes.
  3. Combined PoP projections to yield net revenue estimates.
* **Results:** Achieved **6-month forecast MAPE of 6.23%**, improving over a baseline MA-only MAPE of 10.7%.
* **Implementation:**

  * Built ETL pipelines to ingest and normalize data from Excel sheets and data warehouse.
  * Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau for the FP\&A team, redesigning data sources for quarterly retraining.
* **Impact:** Simplified revenue calculations, automated forecasting workflows, and empowered stakeholders with real‑time insights.

### FinRatioAnalysis (Open Source)

* Developed a Python package for quantitative financial ratio analysis, published on PyPI.
* Includes modules for liquidity, solvency, and profitability metrics, with interactive visualizations.
